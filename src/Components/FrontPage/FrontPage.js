                  Thrilled you've taken a moment to delve deeper. My name is
                  Jose Francisco Bautista. I'm a proud Mexican American from New
                  York City, born in Harlem and raised in Washington Heights. As
                  a Computer Science graduate from Lehman College, I'm always on
                  the lookout for opportunities to hone my programming skills
                  and craft innovative web applications.
                </p>
                <p className="bioParagraph">
                  My passion for technology began in childhood, and I've been
                  enamored with it ever since. I thrive on challenges,
                  constantly pushing my boundaries to grow as a developer.
                  Outside the realm of code, I'm deeply intrigued by the
                  intricacies of the human mind. I often delve into psychology
                  and philosophy books, seeking insights into human behavior and
                  thought processes.

                  Beyond the digital world, I have a flair for mixology, holding
                  a license from the prestigious American Bartenders School.
                  This allows me to blend creativity with precision, much like
                  coding, but in the vibrant world of cocktails. It's always a
                  pleasure to craft a drink that brings a smile to someone's
                  face.
                </p>
                <p className="bioParagraph">
                  When I'm not engrossed in books, code, or experimenting with
                  new cocktail recipes, you might find me exploring new travel
                  destinations, staying active with gym sessions or city jogs,
                  or indulging in my love for anime and true crime
                  documentaries. I cherish the thrill of tackling challenging
                  coding problems and relish opportunities to connect with new
                  people.
                </p>
                <p className="bioParagraph">
                  Driven by a desire to make a positive mark in the tech world
                  and beyond, I'm always eager to collaborate with individuals
                  who share this vision.
